          Hi, My name is Cameron (Chu) Huang, a recent Monash Master of IT graduate specializing in
          full-stack development with a ðŸŒŸpassion for creating solutions that make a difference.
          <br />
          <br />
          Prior to the digital transition, I worked on several construction projects as a civil
          engineer. On the construction site, we not only applied engineering techniques but also
          dealt with site emergencies and did stakeholder management to ensure that the team&apos;s
          work was carried out. This experience gave me a solid foundation in project management and
          teamwork.
          <br />
          <br />I have a diverse set of skills that range from{" "}
          <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong> to front-end technologies such as{" "}
          <strong>ReactJS</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, and back-end technologies like{" "}
          <strong>Express.js</strong> and <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. My proficiency extends to
          testing with <strong>Jest</strong> and <strong>JUnit 5</strong>, databases like{" "}
          <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          I&apos;ve had the privilege to work as a Full-stack Developer at Async Working where I
          gained valuable experience in microservice architecture and Agile methodologies. I was
          part of an 8-person team, developing a range of web applications and maintaining an{" "}
          <strong>AWS</strong> ECS-backed Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. I am proud of the work we did
          there, especially the role I played in developing versatile UI components and establishing
          robust backend RESTful APIs.
